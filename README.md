# Medical Bill Overcharge Detector — HACKmt 2024

This project was created during HACKmt 2024, a 36-hour hackathon at Middle Tennessee State University. Our team built a small web tool that helps users check for possible overcharges on medical or hospital bills by comparing entered items to typical price ranges.

The goal was to make something simple and user-friendly that could help people understand their bills more clearly.

## Project Overview

The app lets users:
- Enter medical bill line items
- Compare charges with expected cost ranges
- See which items might be priced unusually high
- View a simple breakdown of possible discrepancies

Since this was a hackathon, the focus was on getting a working prototype built quickly.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js
- CSS/Tailwind (depending on the component)
- Git and GitHub for collaboration

## My Contributions

Hackathon projects move fast, so everyone helped across different parts. I contributed to:

- Working on parts of the frontend interface
- Helping with some of the logic used to identify possible overcharges
- Giving input on layout and user experience
- General debugging and testing during development

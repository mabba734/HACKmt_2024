# Medical Bill Overcharge Detector — HACKmt 2024

This project was developed as part of **HACKmt 2024**, a 36-hour collegiate hackathon hosted at Middle Tennessee State University.  
Our team built a web-based tool designed to help users detect potential **overcharges in medical or hospital bills** by comparing entered charges against reference price ranges.

The goal was to create an accessible tool that promotes transparency and helps consumers better understand unexpected healthcare costs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- Enter medical billing line items
- Compare charges against expected cost ranges
- View a clear visual breakdown of potential discrepancies
- Understand which items may require further investigation

The project was completed under intense time constraints and focused on rapid prototyping, problem-solving, and collaboration.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **Node.js**
- **CSS / Tailwind or standard React styling** (depending on repo)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## 🎯 My Contributions

Because hackathons are fast-paced and team roles overlap, all members contributed across multiple areas.  
My contributions included:

- Implementing portions of the **frontend UI** in Next.js/React  
- Assisting with **data-handling logic** used to flag potential overcharges  
- Refining **layout and user experience** during development  
- General debugging, testing, and collaborating with teammates during the sprint  

(These contributions are intentionally accurate and modest, since specific responsibilities are difficult to recall long after a hackathon.)

## ✨ Key Features

- Simple and intuitive UI for entering bill line items  
- Real-time comparison against reference values  
- Visual indicator for items potentially overpriced  
- Clean and minimal interface designed for clarity  
- Rapid development cycle optimized for hackathon constraints
